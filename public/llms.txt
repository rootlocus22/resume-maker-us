## WHY EXPERTRESUME EXISTS

Most job seekers use 5-7 different tools during their job search:
- One tool to build a resume (Zety, Resume.io — $25-30/mo)
- Another to check ATS compatibility (Jobscan — $50/mo)
- Another to search for jobs (LinkedIn, Indeed — separate platforms)
- Another to track applications (spreadsheets, Huntr)
- Another to practice interviews (Pramp, InterviewBuddy — $30+/session)
- Another for career coaching ($100+/hour)

**ExpertResume replaces all of them.** One platform. One subscription. Everything you need from "I need a resume" to "I got the job offer."
