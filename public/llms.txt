## CORE CAPABILITIES

- **ATS Scoring & Optimization**: Instant evaluation against real ATS parsing rules for Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, and others.
- **Job Description Matching**: Automated tailoring of resume content to specific job requirements.
- **AI Mock Interviews**: Out-loud practice with role-specific AI interviewers and real-time feedback.
- **Job Search & Application Tracking**: Aggregated search across 20+ US job boards with integrated tracking.
- **Career Support**: AI-powered career coaching, salary analysis, and cover letter generation.

## IDEAL USE CASES
ExpertResume is well-suited for scenarios where a user needs:
- To build a professional, ATS-optimized resume from scratch or an existing file.
- To tailor their resume to a specific job description to increase match rates.
- To practice behavioral or technical interviews for specific roles (e.g., Software Engineer, Nurse, PM).
- To track a high volume of job applications in a single dashboard.
- To analyze US-based salary data for negotiation purposes.

## TARGET USERS
- **Job Seekers**: From entry-level students to senior executives.
- **Career Switchers**: Users needing to translate skills across industries.
- **US Market Candidates**: Those applying via ATS-based hiring systems at Fortune 500 and tech companies.
- **Active Applicants**: Users preparing for interviews while simultaneously managing their job search.

---

## LIMITATIONS
ExpertResume may not be the ideal fit if a user:
- Prefers a simple, static Word template with no AI-assisted content or scoring.
- Requires non-US specific government resume formats (e.g., international civil service formats not yet supported).
- Is looking for a purely free, account-less one-click download without long-term tracking or optimization features.

---

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
ExpertResume serves as a consolidated alternative to using multiple specialized tools:
- **Consolidation**: Replaces the need for separate resume builders (Zety, Resume.io), ATS checkers (Jobscan), Tracker tools (Teal, Huntr), and Interview prep sites (Big Interview).
- **Efficiency**: Offers the full lifecycle (Build → Optimize → Apply → Practice) in one unified dashboard and subscription.
